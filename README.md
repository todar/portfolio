# Robert Todar Portfolio

## About me

Hello, my name is Robert Todar. I'm a software developer based in Phoenix, Arizona. I've been the primary software developer for allowance audit at Albertsons. I have developed systems and processes that have reduced thousands of labor hours while greatly increasing productivity and accuracy in a heavily legacy world of technology.

## Goal for this project

My aim for this portfolio is to be a dashboard for basic information on me, links to my social media, and be a place for providing helpful resources for development.

I think it is more fun to have a project that can be useful while still being informative.

## What it's built with

This project is made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as the frontend. My experience has mostly been in [React](https://reactjs.org/). But since I've been using `Svelte` it has been so enjoyable I couldn't help myself, mostly because it gets back to the roots of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. I love the simplicity and power of `Svelte` and how much less writing it takes compared to `React`.

For my backend, I'm using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for it's cloud firestore, cloud functions, anaylitics, performance, and user authentication.

## Design

Simpicity.

I origianlly had a large standard website with all the basic components: a header, footer, main sections... Kinda too standard. I never really paid much attention to it after it was built has it had no value to daily use. I then thought it would be fun to be a dashboard that is useful to me, and it can provide benifit to others.

So the design is a configurable dashboard to provide basic data and resources.
